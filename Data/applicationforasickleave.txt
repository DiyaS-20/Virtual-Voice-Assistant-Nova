Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to request a sick leave for [number of days] days, from [start date] to [end date], as I am currently unwell and unable to attend work.

Unfortunately, I am suffering from [briefly mention the illness or health issue, e.g. fever, flu, back pain, etc.]. Due to this, I am not in a condition to perform my duties and need some time to recover.

I am undergoing treatment and following the advice of my doctor. I will provide a medical certificate from my doctor, if required.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will make sure to catch up on any missed work as soon as I am feeling better. If there are any pressing tasks that need my attention in the meantime, please let me know and I will do my best to complete them remotely.

Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,

[Your Signature]
[Your Name]
