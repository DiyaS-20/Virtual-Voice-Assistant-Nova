Here is a sample leave request letter:

Dear [Manager's Name],

I am writing to request a leave of absence from [start date] to [end date]. I need to take [number] days off to attend to a personal matter that requires my attention.

I have made sure to review our team's schedule and ensure that my work is up to date, so my absence will not impact our ongoing projects. I will make sure to complete all my tasks and make necessary arrangements before taking my leave.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could approve my request. If there are any concerns or issues, please let me know as soon as possible so we can discuss alternative arrangements.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,
Chris
